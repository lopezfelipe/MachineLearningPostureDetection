# PostureWeightlifting

Poor posture is a very common condition. Posture issues are commonly caaused by muscular imbalances, meaning that some muscles are too tight or too weak. Poor posture can result in several conditions, the most common is back pain, which according to the [American Chiropractic Association](http://www.dlchiropractors.com/uploads/5/8/0/6/58063233/back_pain_facts_and_statistics.pdf) is experienced by 70 to 85 percent of people at some point. Posture problems can be greatly improved by performing the right weightlifting exercises. If, however, an inappropriate posture is maintained while lifting weights, posture problems get even worse. Assistance on weightlifting is often provided by personal trainers. However, measurements gathered with wearable devices may be used as  an alternative for automated assistance and posture correction. This report describes a machine learning approach for automatic quality recognition of posture in weightlifting. Data was gathered from accelerometers mounted on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of six participants to predict the manner in which they exercise.

This study was part of the Practical Machine Learning course, part of the Data Science Specialization of Coursera.
